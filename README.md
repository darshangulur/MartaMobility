# MartaMobility
An iOS application developed during MARTA Hackathon Challenge that won 2nd Best Prize.

The Application solves a real world problem as part of the challenge. A small team of 5 people - 2 devs, 1 Designer, 1 other person responsible for the Idea, presentation and QA - got together and developed the prototype that essentially paved way for the MARTA Mobility group to consider the idea and have further thoughts with their core team.

## Problem
Differently-abled people use a commute service called MARTA Mobility - provided by Metro service Atlanta, GA - for the extra-mile commute to and from the MARTA stations. Most of the times, per one of my team members, the whole customer experience isn't that friendly enough to make it a smooth ride.

1. No mobile way of booking the ride. Only via phone calls to support center.
2. No real-time tracking of Mobility Vans.
3. No real-time information about delays.
4. No mobile way to manage the rides.

## Solution
The solution developed was an iOS mobile application that included following features.

1. Login and account management.
2. Manage rides.
3. Delay tracking.
4. Driver contact and support center communication.
5. Customer tracking using beacons to send automated messages to nominated people.
6. Seamless Integration with all other existing MARTA services.

## Impact
The solution was very welcomed by the MARTA and HAckathon community and was awarded 2nd Best prize in 2 occassions - Oct 2016 and Feb 2017. This also trigerred a lot of post hackathon discussions and meetings with the MARTA executives to discuss about the actual impelmentation in production environment with regards to integration feasibility and scaleability.
